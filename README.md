# ITMD411_Java_TicketApp
The purpose of this project is to construct a trouble tickets system that allows users to login to the IIT help desk and create, view, update, and remove tickets which only admins can modify and delete tickets. Different classes have been created, and a database is linked to a table with populated data that includes users, administrators, and a description of the ticket.
